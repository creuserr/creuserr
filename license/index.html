  <p class="fs-4 text-white mt-4 m-2" id="title">Licensed under CC BY-NC-SA 4.0.</p><br>
  <p>My works are licensed under CC BY-NC-SA 4.0. Nevertheless, subtle adjustments to the license exist, and compliance is requisite. It is pertinent to note that these nuanced modifications do harbor exceptions.</p>
  <p class="fs-5 text-white mt-4"><span class="text-secondary me-2">&num;</span> Usage without credentials</p>
  <p>Your utilization of my works without credentials is permissible unless your project substantially relies on my intellectual contributions. In such instances, a requisite acknowledgment becomes imperative. Conversely, nominal utilization does not inherently demand attribution unless within the contextual ambit of a section delineating third-party libraries, where the obligation to provide due credit becomes inexorable.</p>
  <p class="fs-5 text-white mt-4"><span class="text-secondary me-2">&num;</span> Private adaptation</p>
  <p>Unsanctioned private adaptations are permissible, yet the imperative of crediting remains non-negotiable. Substantive modifications to my work do not necessitate explicit authorization, yet the provision of apt credentials is requisite. Full-scale remakes or recreations necessitate both formal authorization and the provision of judiciously adequate credentials.</p>
  <p class="fs-5 text-white mt-4"><span class="text-secondary me-2">&num;</span> Non-commercial use only</p>
  <p></p>
  <p class="fs-5 text-white mt-4"><span class="text-secondary me-2">&num;</span> Remixes implementation</p>
  <p>Remixes must adhere to the same licensing terms outlined herein. No restrictions are imposed on legal and permitted actions under these terms.<p>
