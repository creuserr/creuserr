  <p class="fs-5 text-white mt-4"><span class="text-secondary me-2">&num;</span> Usage without crediting</p>
  <p>While it's optional to credit my works in your project, if your project lists third-party libraries, providing credentials for my work with the CC-BY-4.0 license is required. Importantly, you cannot use my works and claim them as your own.</p>

  <p>Public remixing is allowed with proper authorization and credit. When publicly remixing my works, crediting is mandatory. Authorization is required for significant changes; for example, if you fork and make major alterations to my work.</p>
