    <p>My works are licensed under <a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/">CC BY-NC-SA 4.0</a>. Nevertheless, subtle adjustments to the license exist, and compliance is requisite. It is pertinent to note that these nuanced modifications do harbor exceptions.</p>

    <p>Your utilization of my works without credentials is permissible unless your project substantially relies on my intellectual contributions.

    <p>Unsanctioned private adaptations are permissible, yet the imperative of crediting remains non-negotiable. Substantive modifications to my work do not necessitate explicit authorization, yet the provision of apt credentials is requisite.

    <p class="title fs-4 m-2 mt-4">Privaxy Policy</p>
    <p>Effective December 19, 2023.</p>
    <p>This privacy policy serves as the fulcrum upon which our commitment to the responsible stewardship of user data is articulated across a myriad of our works, delineating the intricate tapestry of our practices concerning data handling, sharing, and utilization.</p>
    <p class="fs-5 text-white mt-4"><span class="text-secondary me-2">&num;</span> Information Collection Emanation</p>
    <p>Our data purview predominantly encompasses the extraction of nomenclature, user agents, public API addresses, and electronic mail, with select instances necessitating the retrieval of additional personal vestiges such as telephone numbers.</p>
    <p class="fs-5 text-white mt-4"><span class="text-secondary me-2">&num;</span> Methodological Harvesting of Data Quotients</p>
    <p>Our data collection methodologies extend across the terrain of user input mechanisms, confluence with browser/client parameters, and the orchestration of analytics mechanisms.</p>
    <p class="fs-5 text-white mt-4"><span class="text-secondary me-2">&num;</span> Teleology of Data Harvesting Processes</p>
    <p>The imbued purpose of our data aggregation endeavors is steeped in the elevation of user experience. In instances where user invocation precipitates an account creation, the imperative necessitates the solicitation of electronic mail and nomenclature. Furthermore, our analytics stratagem may, selectively, encapsulate the acquisition of public IP addresses, user agents, and granular browser/client particulars.</p>
    <p class="fs-5 text-white mt-4"><span class="text-secondary me-2">&num;</span> Symbiotic Nexus with Third-Party Apparatus</p>
    <p>Our operational milieu may interlink with third-party libraries, notably exemplified by entities such as Google Analytics. It is imperative to note that the methodologies of data collection inherent in these auxiliary frameworks are autonomous and exhibit divergence from our own.</p>
    <p class="fs-5 text-white mt-4"><span class="text-secondary me-2">&num;</span> Impenetrable Bastions of Security Alchemy</p>
    <p>The vast corpus of data resident within our purview is subjected to the alchemy of encryption and compression methodologies. In instances where data of a security-sensitive nature is domiciled, the vanguard is fortified through the aegis of efficacious hashing protocols.</p>
    <p class="fs-5 text-white mt-4"><span class="text-secondary me-2">&num;</span> Rights of the Cognizant User</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p class="text-white m-0">Exigency of Data expungement</p>
        <p>The cognizant user, duly validated as the rightful proprietor, reserves the prerogative to petition for the expungement of data.</p>
