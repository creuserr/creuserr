  <p>My works are licensed under CC-BY-4.0. However, there are some modifications to the license that you must adhere to:</p>
  <p class="title"></p>

1. **Usage without crediting:** While it's optional to credit my works in your project, if your project lists third-party libraries, providing credentials for my work with the CC-BY-4.0 license is required. Importantly, you cannot use my works and claim them as your own.

2. **Public remixing:** Public remixing is allowed with proper authorization and credit. When publicly remixing my works, crediting is mandatory. Authorization is required for significant changes; for example, if you fork and make major alterations to my work.
