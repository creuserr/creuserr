    <p>My works are licensed under <a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/">CC BY-NC-SA 4.0</a>. Nevertheless, subtle adjustments to the license exist, and compliance is requisite. It is pertinent to note that these nuanced modifications do harbor exceptions.</p>
    <p class="fs-5 text-white mt-4"><span class="text-secondary me-2">&num;</span> Usage without credentials</p>
    <p>Your utilization of my works without credentials is permissible unless your project substantially relies on my intellectual contributions. In such instances, a requisite acknowledgment becomes imperative. Conversely, nominal utilization does not inherently demand attribution unless within the contextual ambit of a section delineating third-party libraries, where the obligation to provide due credit becomes inexorable.</p>
    <p class="fs-5 text-white mt-4"><span class="text-secondary me-2">&num;</span> Private adaptation</p>
    <p>Unsanctioned private adaptations are permissible, yet the imperative of crediting remains non-negotiable. Substantive modifications to my work do not necessitate explicit authorization, yet the provision of apt credentials is requisite. Full-scale remakes or recreations necessitate both formal authorization and the provision of judiciously adequate credentials.</p>
    <p class="fs-5 text-white mt-4"><span class="text-secondary me-2">&num;</span> Non-commercial use only <span class="text-secondary">(NC)</span></p>
    <p>Although my works embrace an open-source ethos, commercial utilization&mdash;encompassing the act of selling or revenue generation&mdash;is expressly proscribed. This prohibition holds firm irrespective of possessing credentials or explicit authorization.</p>
    <p class="fs-5 text-white mt-4"><span class="text-secondary me-2">&num;</span> Remixes implementation <span class="text-secondary">(SA)</span></p>
    <p>Remixes are obligated to adhere unwaveringly to the identical licensing terms elucidated herein. No constraints are imposed on actions that are both legal and permissible within the ambit of these stipulations.<p>
